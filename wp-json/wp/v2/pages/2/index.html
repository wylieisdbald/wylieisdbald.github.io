Affectionately known (to himself) as &#8220;The Educational Eagle,&#8221; David manages to keep his shiny dome gleaming brighter than the hopes and dreams of the schoolchildren in his district.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born into a family of humble pencil manufacturers, David didn&#8217;t just rise through the ranks, he burst through, shattering the glass ceiling with the sheer force of his own bloated self-importance. His unchecked ego, you see, is not a flaw\u2014it\u2019s a superpower that has repelled any self-awareness that might threaten his trajectory. He is a black hole of accountability, where mistakes go to disappear and never to be spoken of again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His motto? &#8220;An unblemished record is a result of a good memory, not good leadership.&#8221; And as the keeper of the District&#8217;s coffers, he has taken that to heart, ensuring that every dollar the taxpayers generously contribute is spent judiciously. And by judiciously, we mean at the local Chick-fil-A, which he keeps in business single-handedly, and where the employees know him on a first-name basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David&#8217;s love for Chick-fil-A is the stuff of legends. They say the Chick-fil-A cow mascots are his closest advisers, and indeed, he has been seen talking to them on more than one occasion. But it&#8217;s not just the fried chicken that&#8217;s so appealing to him\u2014it&#8217;s the idea of being a big fish in a small pond, a VIP customer where the employees stand to attention as he waddles in, ordering enough food to feed an army. Or, as it happens, one superintendent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s not forget about his record-breaking ego, a thing of beauty and awe. It&#8217;s so large, in fact, that it requires its own administrative assistant, who tirelessly catalogues David&#8217;s achievements, real and imagined. As the saying goes, &#8220;an ego the size of David&#8217;s isn&#8217;t built in a day, it&#8217;s a full-time job.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His love for self-portraits in the district buildings is surpassed only by his fascination for reflective surfaces. The more he can see of himself, the better. Mirrors, window panes, highly polished desks, all bear the phantom smudge of David\u2019s proud gaze. Of course, this incessant need for reflection can lead to some hiccups. Like that time when a full-scale evacuation was prompted because David mistook his own reflection in the cafeteria window for a nefarious doppelganger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, under David&#8217;s steadfast (mis)leadership, Wylie ISD has not just endured but thrived. If &#8220;thrived&#8221; is defined by skyrocketing fried chicken sales and the implementation of the annual &#8220;Dr. Vinson Day,&#8221; where students are encouraged to wear bald caps and Chick-fil-A-themed attire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, David Vinson is not just a superintendent. He&#8217;s a spectacle, an experience, a lesson in how to command a room (or a school district) with an iron fist and an elastic waistband. Truly, a beacon of light&#8230;bouncing off his impeccably polished, ever-gleaming, bald head.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introducing Superintendent &#8220;Dr.&#8221; David Vinson, the follically challenged titan of educational bureaucracy, ruling the roost of the Wylie Independent School District (ISD) with a charisma as expansive as his waistline and an ego that&#8217;s stratospheric.
